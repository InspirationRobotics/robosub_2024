# Explanation of the Tests

## acro_test.py

This was a file generated utilizing ChatGPT. It contains four iterations of an AUV class with an attempt to implement a roll capability utilizing the ACRO flight mode (to get 800 more points in the style portion of the gate mission). The script was never run and probably doesn't work. It could be useful sample material, but do not run this script.

## acro_test2.py

This file utilizes the fourth iteration of the AUV class from acro_test.py without modification. 

## acro_test3.py

This file has some modifications from acro_test2.py regarding how the arming is performed. The barometer data is omitted, and AUV is no longer a subclass of RosHandler.
